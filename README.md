We all have places that we’d like to see, things we’d like to do. Bukit list is here to help you make future travel plans and document old ones!

Make your own Bukit List account (with the help of Google Auth) and you’ll be directed to your personal Bukit List page. It’s a bit empty to begin with, but that will change soon.

The add (+) button will bring up a short form for adding a city to your list. Simply include its name, state abbreviation, and check whether you’ve already visited or not. Submitting the form will add the city to your list.

Once on your list, the city name can be clicked, and its info panel will expand. The panel will include current weather and news on the city, provided by custom API requests.

Also included are your personal notes on the city. This is the place to make plans for future travels or write about what you’ve already done.

All cities and notes can be removed if desired, allowing you to make ongoing changes to your Bukit List based on your travels.
